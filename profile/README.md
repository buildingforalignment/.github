## Welcome to buildingforalignment 👋

Hi there!

buildingforalignment is a home for advancing the use of computational sciences in psychology and philosophy research.

Particular interests include the use of simulation methods, reinforcement learning and large language models to better understand human 
nature and the nature of reality, as we experience it.

This work takes the view that agent models may be useful models of human cognition. No claims are made about the potential equivalency of 
these models to human cognition. All models are analogies of a system, used to study a subset of the qualities of the system. We believe 
there exist uncountable numbers of computational models which may help us study human cognition and the resulting philosophical implications.

It may be helpful to think of this research as an extension of what exists today in the form of animal research (including studying the very 
small e.g. single cells, and much larger e.g. other primates), where animals are simply one kind of model. This extension is useful because 
computational models have very adventageous characteristics. Similar, to animal research, many experiments which would be infeasible due to 
ethics concerns can now be feasibly studied. Beyond ethics, some experiments become feasible due to the removal of practical constraints e.g. 
problems around replicating treatments, observability of the system, manipulation of the system, etc. go away when using compuational models.  

We believe that at this stage of this research discipline's maturity\*, the way in which we may maximize impact is by bringing greater 
awareness to the utility of these methods, to drive further investment. We do this by: 
1) activitely contributing to this area of research as evidence of its utility,
2) bring attention to work being done in this area via community engagement, and
3) bridge theoretical research and practical applicability, in order to align incentivizes towards funding

\* it would be interesting to build intuition on this claim using compuational methods

Below is a list of research topics planned:
- [In progress] What does the distribution of lifetime rewards, despite using the same starting model, tell us about agency?
- What happens if an agent has multiple reward functions? What happens based on varying correlations between the reward functions (i.e. positive = aligned, negative = misaligned)?
- What happens if different agents in the system have different reward functions? Does this impact the degree of co-operations versus competition? Do particular social behaviour patterns emerge?
- Does human cognition depend on random sampling processes? How does this relate to the ramdomness seen in other agents?
- How do partnering agents affect stability and long term orientation?
